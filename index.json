Estimators requiring pseudo-randomization provide estimates with no bias (i.e., strong internal validity) but limited generalizability (i.e., weak external validity).  Theoretically, causal forest, a non-parametric, machine-learning-based matching estimator, can provide low-to-no-bias, generalizable estimates even when treatment is endogenous.  We empirically compare the performance of OLS, regression discontinuity design (RDD), and causal forest at recovering estimates in simulated observational panel data and show the robustness of causal forest estimates to many sources of bias.  We re-visit a popular RDD setting, debt covenant default, to show how extendable, heterogeneous causal forest estimates can enhance inferences.","tags":[],"title":"Balancing external vs. internal validity: An application of causal forest in finance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huseyin Gulen","Mihai Ion","Candace E.

Using predictable firm-level forecast errors, we build an aggregate index of irrational expectations and use it to provide three sets of results. First, we show that our index predicts aggregate credit cycles. Next, we show that these predictable credit cycles drive cycles in firm-level debt issuance and investment and similar cycles between financially constrained and unconstrained firms, as Minsky predicts. Finally, we show more pronounced cycles in firm-level financing and investment for firms with ex ante more optimistic expectations.

Then, for four quarters around elections when uncertainty and external financing costs are high, firms decrease investment and draw down saved cash balances to avoid tapping external financing. We use a dynamic model of firm investment and saving to demonstrate the importance of anticipation of future financing costs to firms' pre-election precautionary saving behavior. Theoretically, if election uncertainty were only to affect potential investment, lower firm investment would result in higher contemporaneous cash balances, which is inconsistent with our empirical results.","tags":[],"title":"Uncertainty, precautionary saving, and investment: Evidence from prescheduled election cycles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Candace E.

However, all evidence of abnormal returns is limited to the sell-side of the portfolio, which is inconsistent with anecdotal evidence of Congress members supporting legislation favorable to firms in which they are invested. Pre-60 Minutes, Senators' sells were well-timed, occurring within eight weeks of drops in securities' prices and avoiding 5.4% in annualized abnormal portfolio losses. This abnormal return is concentrated in trades made before key pieces of legislation exited committee and in trades by more senior Senators and Senators sitting on more powerful committees, suggesting Senators profited from private information learned through participation in the legislative process. We find no evidence consistent with Senators' stock holdings contributing to value creation that is typically associated with firm political connections.","tags":[],"title":"Change in capitol: How a 60 Minutes exposé and the STOCK Act affected the investment activity of U.S. Senators","type":"working"},{"authors":["Candace E.

Investment declines 5% before all elections and up to 15% for subsamples of firms particularly susceptible to political uncertainty.

Because close elections are related to economic downturns, I find that the effect of close elections on investment is understated by more than half by ordinary least squares (OLS).
